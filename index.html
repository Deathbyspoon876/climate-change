							<h2>The Issue</h2>
							<p>The world is currently facing a climate crisis - climate temperatures are rising, natural disasters, especially bushfires and droughts, are becoming significantly more severe, sea levels are rising, and people are suffering. The rising temperatures are majorly caused by the release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, trapping heat inside the Earth’s surface. Majority of the greenhouse gases are released when humans burn fossil fuels when coal mining or generating electricity. People everywhere are facing “untold suffering due to the climate crisis” unless there are major transformations to global society, according to a stark warning from more than 11,000 scientists. </p>

							<h2>How it started</h2>
							<p>Humans initially noticed a significant rise in global temperatures in the 1900s, after the Industrial Revolution occurred and the generation of electricity became highly prevalent. "The Cairo Compact: Toward a Concerted World-Wide Response to the Climate Crisis", released on December 21, 1989, was the first report to refer to the climate issue as a “crisis”. The document stated that "All nations... will have to cooperate on an unprecedented scale. They will have to make difficult commitments without delay to address this crisis."</p>

							<h2>What Changes Have Been Made?</h2>
							<p>Climate change is an issue that cannot be solved overnight - or even over years. It is a gradual movement from the burning of fossil fuels and agriculture to clean energy and food. It takes decades to reach this goal, especially on such a large scale.<br><br>

                            What these rallies have done is put pressure on the governments and leading bodies to change. The public wants to change and it wants in fast, and it is beginning to work. In 2019, 12.9% of the world’s energy is from renewables, up from 11.6 in 2018. We are clearly beginning to change, but the world wants to do it faster.

							<h2>Social Media's Role</h2>
							<p>Social media is influencing the way in which we protest and the way in which news is spread.. It allows anyone to post their opinions, share updates on a rally or share informative posts on a subject they are passionate about. Social media connects people with similar views and gives everyone a voice to protest. Additionally, social media has changed the way in which people organise events such as climate marches or rallies and made it as easy as simply posting the details and waiting for people to show up. <br><br>

Social Media has made millions of people aware of the climate crisis that our Earth is facing and is the primary reason for the sudden rise in interest regarding this issue. This has been done through the increasing number of organisations posting updates, information and statistics surrounding the topic on platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. Additionally, influencers and celebrities have jumped on board this discussion and are doing their part to make a difference and to use their fame and high follower count for a good cause by spreading information to a large audience.
